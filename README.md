# Excel-Bike-Sales
Excel dashboard created from bike sales data for customer discovery
  
Using a raw excel dataset of 1000+ datapoints, each with the customer's marital status, gender, income and more. I cleaned the data and created multiple pivot tables to find the average income of customers per purchase, the distance of customer's commute distance, and what age bracket are customers in. Each of these pivot tables can show the bike store owner who their customer base is and make decisions based on what is found. In order to display the results, I created a dashboard within Excel that incorporates each pivot table and added slicers so the user can manipulate what is shown in each visual. Slicers inlcude marital status, education, occupation and more. This is so the user can narrow down the results to find more specific results.
